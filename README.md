## Introduction
* This project will show a visual representation of Pokemon that fulfill certain attributes that the user can filter by<br/>
* The user can currently filter by name and by type both individually and simultaneously<br/>
* The display is in the form of a Pokedex with basic information such as an image, name, typing, Pokedex number, and Pokedex description<br/>
* When a Pokemon is selected, a card is brought up with greater depth to show the abilities and statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)<br/>
* The Pokedex entries are by default sorted in ascending order of the Pokedex number but this can be changed upon user selection<br/>
* Filtering is enabled by type and the Pokedex number while the entries are able to be sorted in either ascending or descending order<br/>
